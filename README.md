## The Icepack sea-ice column model
This repository contains files for Icepack, the column physics of the sea ice model [CICE][cice]. Icepack is maintained by the CICE Consortium.  For testing purposes and guidance for including Icepack in other sea ice host models, this repository also includes a driver and basic test suite.   

Icepack is included in CICE as a Git submodule.  Because Icepack is a submodule of CICE, Icepack and CICE development are handled independently with respect to the GitHub repositories even though development and testing can be done together.
