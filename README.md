## The Icepack sea-ice column model
This repository contains files for Icepack, the column physics of the sea ice model [CICE][cice]. Icepack is maintained by the CICE Consortium.  For testing purposes and guidance for including Icepack in other sea ice host models, this repository also includes a driver and basic test suite.   

Icepack is included in CICE as a Git submodule.  Because Icepack is a submodule of CICE, Icepack and CICE development are handled independently with respect to the GitHub repositories even though development and testing can be done together.

## Getting help
If you still need help getting started using the model afer reviewing the [model documentation][doc-resources], the first point of contact with the CICE Consortium is the [Consortium Community Forum][forum]. This forum is monitored by Consortium members and is also open to the whole community. **Please do not use our issue tracker for general support questions.**
