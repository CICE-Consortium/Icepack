<p>The current Icepack version includes three thermodynamics
options, the “zero-layer” thermodynamics of <a class="reference internal" href="../zreferences.html#semtner76" id="id1">[40]</a>
(<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ktherm</span></code> = 0), the Bitz and Lipscomb model <a class="reference internal" href="../zreferences.html#bl99" id="id2">[6]</a>
(<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ktherm</span></code> = 1) that assumes a fixed salinity profile, and a “mushy”
formulation (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ktherm</span></code> = 2) in which salinity evolves
<a class="reference internal" href="../zreferences.html#thb13" id="id3">[47]</a>. For each thickness category, Icepack computes
changes in the ice and snow thickness and vertical temperature profile
resulting from radiative, turbulent, and conductive heat fluxes. The ice
has a temperature-dependent specific heat to simulate the effect of
brine pocket melting and freezing, for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ktherm</span></code> = 1 and 2.</p>
<p>Each thickness category <span class="math">\(n\)</span> in each grid cell is treated as a
horizontally uniform column with ice thickness
<span class="math">\(h_{in} = v_{in}/a_{in}\)</span> and snow thickness
<span class="math">\(h_{sn} = v_{sn}/a_{in}\)</span>. (Henceforth we omit the category
index&nbsp;<span class="math">\(n\)</span>.) Each column is divided into <span class="math">\(N_i\)</span> ice layers
of thickness <span class="math">\(\Delta h_i = h_i/N_i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(N_s\)</span> snow layers of
thickness <span class="math">\(\Delta h_s = h_s/N_s\)</span>. The surface temperature (i.e.,
the temperature of ice or snow at the interface with the atmosphere) is
<span class="math">\(T_{sf}\)</span>, which cannot exceed <span class="math">\(0^{\circ}C\)</span>. The temperature at the
midpoint of the snow layer is <span class="math">\(T_s\)</span>, and the midpoint ice layer
temperatures are <span class="math">\(T_{ik}\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(k\)</span> ranges from 1 to
<span class="math">\(N_i\)</span>. The temperature at the bottom of the ice is held at
<span class="math">\(T_f\)</span>, the freezing temperature of the ocean mixed layer. All
temperatures are in degrees Celsius unless stated otherwise.</p>
<p>Each ice layer has an enthalpy <span class="math">\(q_{ik}\)</span>, defined as the negative
of the energy required to melt a unit volume of ice and raise its
temperature to <span class="math">\(0^{\circ}C\)</span>. Because of internal melting and freezing in brine
pockets, the ice enthalpy depends on the brine pocket volume and is a
function of temperature and salinity. We can also define a snow enthalpy
<span class="math">\(q_s\)</span>, which depends on temperature alone.</p>
<p>Given surface forcing at the atmosphere–ice and ice–ocean interfaces
along with the ice and snow thicknesses and temperatures/enthalpies at
time <span class="math">\(m\)</span>, the thermodynamic model advances these quantities to
time <span class="math">\(m+1\)</span> (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ktherm</span></code> = 2 also advances salinity). The calculation
proceeds in two steps. First we solve a set of equations for the new
temperatures, as discussed in the&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="#thermo-temp"><span class="std std-ref">New temperatures</span></a> section. Then we
compute the melting, if any, of ice or snow at the top surface, and the
growth or melting of ice at the bottom surface, as described in
the&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="#thermo-growth"><span class="std std-ref">Growth and melting</span></a> section. We begin by describing the melt ponds and surface
forcing parameterizations, which are closely related to the ice and snow
surface temperatures.</p>
<div class="section" id="melt-ponds">
<span id="ponds"></span><h2>2.6.1. Melt ponds<a class="headerlink" href="#melt-ponds" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Three explicit melt pond parameterizations are available in Icepack, and
all must use the delta-Eddington radiation scheme, described below. The
ccsm3 shortwave parameterization incorporates melt ponds
implicitly by adjusting the albedo based on surface conditions.</p>
<p>For each of the three explicit parameterizations, a volume
<span class="math">\(\Delta V_{melt}\)</span> of melt water produced on a given category may
be added to the melt pond liquid volume:</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-meltvol">
<span class="eqno">(1)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-meltvol" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[\Delta V_{melt} = {r\over\rho_w} \left({\rho_{i}}\Delta h_{i} + {\rho_{s}}\Delta h_{s} + F_{rain}{\Delta t}\right) a_i,\]</div>
<p>where</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-melt-retention">

<p>is the fraction of the total melt water available that is added to the
ponds, <span class="math">\(\rho_i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\rho_s\)</span> are ice and snow densities,
<span class="math">\(\Delta h_i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\Delta h_s\)</span> are the thicknesses of ice and
snow that melted, and <span class="math">\(F_{rain}\)</span> is the rainfall rate. Namelist
parameters are set for the level-ice (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tr_pond_lvl</span></code>) parameterization;
in the cesm and topo pond schemes the standard values of <span class="math">\(r_{max}\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(r_{min}\)</span> are 0.7 and 0.15, respectively.</p>
<p>Radiatively, the surface of an ice category is divided into fractions of
snow, pond and bare ice. In these melt pond schemes, the actual pond
area and depth are maintained throughout the simulation according to the
physical processes acting on it. However, snow on the sea ice and pond
ice may shield the pond and ice below from solar radiation. These
processes do not alter the actual pond volume; instead they are used to
define an “effective pond fraction” (and likewise, effective pond depth,
snow fraction and snow depth) used only for the shortwave radiation
calculation.</p>
<p>In addition to the physical processes discussed below, tracer equations
and definitions for melt ponds are also described in
the&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="sg_tracers.html#tracers"><span class="std std-ref">Tracers</span></a> section.</p>

<p>Melt pond area and thickness tracers are carried on each ice thickness
category as in the&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="sg_tracers.html#tracers"><span class="std std-ref">Tracers</span></a> section. Defined simply as the product

<p>where <span class="math">\(dh_{i}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(dh_{s}\)</span> represent ice and snow melt at

<span class="math">\(T_p\)</span> is a reference temperature equal to <span class="math">\(-2^\circ\)</span>C.
Pond depth is assumed to be a linear function of the pond fraction
(<span class="math">\(h_p=\delta_p a_p\)</span>) and is limited by the category ice thickness
(<span class="math">\(h_p \le 0.9 h_i\)</span>). The pond shape (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pndaspect</span></code>)
<span class="math">\(\delta_p = 0.8\)</span> in the standard CESM pond configuration. The area
and thickness are computed according to the assumed pond shape, and the
pond area is then reduced in the presence of snow for the radiation
calculation. Ponds are allowed only on ice at least 1&nbsp;cm thick. This
formulation differs slightly from that documented in
<a class="reference internal" href="../zreferences.html#hbblh12" id="id4">[19]</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="topographic-formulation-tr-pond-topo-true">
<h3>2.6.1.2. Topographic formulation (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">tr_pond_topo</span></code> = true)<a class="headerlink" href="#topographic-formulation-tr-pond-topo-true" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The principle concept of this scheme is that melt water runs downhill
under the influence of gravity and collects on sea ice with increasing
surface height starting at the lowest height
<a class="reference internal" href="../zreferences.html#ff07" id="id5">[12]</a><a class="reference internal" href="../zreferences.html#fft10" id="id6">[13]</a><a class="reference internal" href="../zreferences.html#fsfh12" id="id7">[14]</a>. Thus, the topography of the
ice cover plays a crucial role in determining the melt pond cover.
However, Icepack does not explicitly represent the topography of sea ice.
Therefore, we split the existing ice thickness distribution function
into a surface height and basal depth distribution assuming that each
sea ice thickness category is in hydrostatic equilibrium at the
beginning of the melt season. We then calculate the position of sea
level assuming that the ice in the whole grid cell is rigid and in
hydrostatic equilibrium.</p>

</div>
<p>Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-topo"><span class="std std-ref">Melt Ponds</span></a> illustrates (a) Schematic illustration of the relationship between the height of the pond surface <span class="math">\(h_{pnd,tot}\)</span>, the volume of water
<span class="math">\(V_{Pk}\)</span> required to completely fill up to category <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, the
volume of water <span class="math">\(V_{P} - V_{Pk}\)</span>, and the depth to which this
fills category <span class="math">\(k + 1\)</span>. Ice and snow areas <span class="math">\(a_i\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(a_s\)</span> are also depicted. The volume calculation takes account of
the presence of snow, which may be partially or completely saturated.
(b) Schematic illustration indicating pond surface height
<span class="math">\(h_{pnd,tot}\)</span> and sea level <span class="math">\(h_{sl}\)</span> measured with respect
to the thinnest surface height category <span class="math">\(h_{i1}\)</span>, the submerged
portion of the floe <span class="math">\(h_{sub}\)</span>, and hydraulic head <span class="math">\(\Delta H\)</span>
. A positive hydraulic head (pond surface above sea level) will flush
melt water through the sea ice into the ocean; a negative hydraulic head
can drive percolation of sea water onto the ice surface. Here,
<span class="math">\(\alpha=0.6\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\beta=0.4\)</span> are the surface height and
basal depth distribution fractions. The height of the steps is the
height of the ice above the reference level, and the width of the steps
is the area of ice of that height. The illustration does not imply a
particular assumed topography, rather it is assumed that all thickness
categories are present at the sub-grid scale so that water will always
flow to the lowest surface height class.</p>
<p>Once a volume of water is produced from ice and snow melting, we
calculate the number of ice categories covered by water. At each time
step, we construct a list of volumes of water
<span class="math">\(\{V_{P1}, V_{P2}, . . . V_{P,k-1}, V_{Pk},\)</span>
<span class="math">\(V_{P,k+1}, . . . \}\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(V_{Pk}\)</span> is the volume of water
required to completely cover the ice and snow in the surface height
categories from <span class="math">\(i = 1\)</span> to <span class="math">\(i = k\)</span>. The volume
<span class="math">\(V_{Pk}\)</span> is defined so that if the volume of water <span class="math">\(V_{P}\)</span>
is such that <span class="math">\(V_{Pk} &lt; V_{P} &lt; V_{P,k+1}\)</span> then the snow and ice in
categories <span class="math">\(n = 1\)</span> to <span class="math">\(n = k + 1\)</span> are covered in melt
water. Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-topo"><span class="std std-ref">Melt Ponds</span></a> (a) depicts the areas covered in melt water and
saturated snow on the surface height (rather than thickness) categories
<span class="math">\(h_{top,k}\)</span>. Note in the code, we assume that
<span class="math">\(h_{top,n}/h_{in} = 0.6\)</span> (an arbitrary choice). The fractional
area of the <span class="math">\(n\)</span>th category covered in snow is <span class="math">\(a_{sn}\)</span>.
The volume <span class="math">\(V_{P1}\)</span>, which is the region with vertical hatching,
is the volume of water required to completely fill the first
thickness category, so that any extra melt water must occupy the second
thickness category, and it is given by the expression</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-topo-vol1">
<span class="eqno">(4)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-topo-vol1" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[V_{P1} = a_{i1} (h_{top,2}-h_{top,1}) - a_{s1} a_{i1} h_{s1} (1-V_{sw}),\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(V_{sw}\)</span> is the fraction of the snow volume that can be
occupied by water, and <span class="math">\(h_{s1}\)</span> is the snow depth on ice height

<p>(Note that we have implicitly assumed that
<span class="math">\(h_{si} &lt; h_{top,k+1} - h_{top,k}\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(k\)</span>.) No melt
water can be stored on the thickest ice thickness category. If the melt
water volume exceeds the volume calculated above, the remaining melt
water is released to the ocean.</p>
<p>At each time step, the pond height above the level of the thinnest
surface height class, that is, the maximum pond depth, is diagnosed from
the list of volumes <span class="math">\(V_{Pk}\)</span>. In particular, if the total volume
of melt water <span class="math">\(V_{P}\)</span> is such that
<span class="math">\(V_{Pk} &lt; V_{P} &lt; V_{P,k+1}\)</span> then the pond height

ice in class <span class="math">\(k\)</span> and partially fills the volume between

that <span class="math">\(h_{top,k} - h_{top,1}\)</span> is the height of the melt water,
which has volume <span class="math">\(V_{Pk}\)</span>, which completely fills the surface

<p>As the melting season progresses, not only does melt water accumulate
upon the upper surface of the sea ice, but the sea ice beneath the melt
water becomes more porous owing to a reduction in solid fraction
<a class="reference internal" href="../zreferences.html#egprf04" id="id8">[9]</a>. The hydraulic head of melt water on sea
ice (i.e., its height above sea level) drives flushing of melt water
through the porous sea ice and into the underlying ocean. The mushy
thermodynamics scheme (<cite>ktherm</cite>&nbsp;= 2) handles flushing. For
<cite>ktherm</cite>&nbsp;<span class="math">\(\ne 2\)</span> we model the vertical flushing rate using Darcy’s
law for flow through a porous medium</p>

<p>Since the solid fraction varies throughout the depth of the sea ice, so
does the permeability. The rate of vertical drainage is determined by
the lowest (least permeable) layer, corresponding to the highest solid
fraction. From the equations describing sea ice as a mushy layer

the pond is regarded as effective, i.e. the pond affects the optical
properties of the ice cover. Effective pond area and pond depth for each
thickness category are passed to the radiation scheme for calculating
albedo. Note that once the ice lid has exceeded the critical thickness,
snow may accumulate on the lid causing a substantial increase in albedo.
In the current CICE model, melt ponds only affect the thermodynamics of
the ice through the albedo. To conserve energy, the ice lid is dismissed
once the pond is completely refrozen.</p>

over the lost area is released to the ocean immediately. In

<p>This meltpond parameterization represents a combination of ideas from
the empirical CESM melt pond scheme and the topo approach, and is
documented in <a class="reference internal" href="../zreferences.html#hhl13" id="id14">[21]</a>. The ponds evolve according to
physically based process descriptions, assuming a thickness-area ratio
for changes in pond volume. A novel aspect of the new scheme is that the
ponds are carried as tracers on the level (undeformed) ice area of each
thickness category, thus limiting their spatial extent based on the
simulated sea ice topography. This limiting is meant to approximate the
horizontal drainage of melt water into depressions in ice floes. (The
primary difference between the level-ice and topo meltpond
parameterizations lies in how sea ice topography is taken into account
when determining the areal coverage of ponds.) Infiltration of the snow
by melt water postpones the appearance of ponds and the subsequent
acceleration of melting through albedo feedback, while snow on top of
refrozen pond ice also reduces the ponds’ effect on the radiation
budget.</p>
<p>Melt pond processes, described in more detail below, include addition of
liquid water from rain, melting snow and melting surface ice, drainage
of pond water when its weight pushes the ice surface below sea level or
when the ice interior becomes permeable, and refreezing of the pond
water. If snow falls after a layer of ice has formed on the ponds, the
snow may block sunlight from reaching the ponds below. When melt water
forms with snow still on the ice, the water is assumed to infiltrate the
snow. If there is enough water to fill the air spaces within the
snowpack, then the pond becomes visible above the snow, thus decreasing
the albedo and ultimately causing the snow to melt faster. The albedo
also decreases as snow depth decreases, and thus a thin layer of snow
remaining above a pond-saturated layer of snow will have a lower albedo
than if the melt water were not present.</p>
<p>The level-ice formulation assumes a thickness-area ratio for <em>changes</em>
in pond volume, while the CESM scheme assumes this ratio for the total
pond volume. Pond volume changes are distributed as changes to the area
and to the depth of the ponds using an assumed aspect ratio, or shape,
given by the parameter <span class="math">\(\delta_p\)</span> (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pndaspect</span></code>),

<p>B. The <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">frzpnd</span></code> = ‘cesm’ option uses the same empirical function as in the
CESM melt pond parameterization.</p>
<p><em>Radiative effects.</em> Freshwater ice that has formed on top of a melt
pond is assumed to be perfectly clear. Snow may accumulate on top of the
pond ice, however, shading the pond and ice below. The depth of the snow
on the pond ice is initialized as <span class="math">\(h_{ps}^0 = F_{snow}\Delta t\)</span> at
the first snowfall after the pond ice forms. From that time until either
the pond ice or the pond snow disappears, the pond snow depth tracks the
depth of snow on sea ice (<span class="math">\(h_s\)</span>) using a constant difference
<span class="math">\(\Delta\)</span>. As <span class="math">\(h_s\)</span> melts, <span class="math">\(h_{ps}=h_s-\Delta\)</span> will be
reduced to zero eventually, at which time the pond ice is fully
uncovered and shortwave radiation passes through.</p>
<p>To prevent a sudden change in the shortwave reaching the sea ice (which
can prevent the thermodynamics from converging), thin layers of snow on
pond ice are assumed to be patchy, thus allowing the shortwave flux to
increase gradually as the layer thins. This is done using the same
parameterization for patchy snow as is used elsewhere in Icepack, but with
its own parameter <span class="math">\(h_{s1}\)</span>:</p>

<p>If any of the pond ice melts, the radiative flux allowed to pass through
the ice is reduced by the (roughly) equivalent flux required to melt
that ice. This is accomplished (approximately) with
<span class="math">\(a_{pnd}^{eff} = (1-f_{frac})a_{pnd}a_{lvl}\)</span>, where (see

<p><em>Snow infiltration by pond water.</em> If there is snow on top of the sea
ice, melt water may infiltrate the snow. It is a “virtual process” that
affects the model’s thermodynamics through the input parameters of the
radiation scheme; it does not melt the snow or affect the snow heat
content.</p>
<p>A snow pack is considered saturated when its percentage of liquid water
content is greater or equal to 15% (Sturm and others, 2009). We assume
that if the volume fraction of retained melt water to total liquid
content</p>

<p>then effectively there are no meltponds present, that is,

<p>We assume that all of the liquid water accumulates at the base of the
snow pack and would eventually melt the surrounding snow. Two
configurations are therefore possible, (1) the top of the liquid lies
below the snow surface and (2) the liquid water volume overtops the
snow, and all of the snow is assumed to have melted into the pond. The

water is</p>

<p>The liquid water under the snow layer is not visible and therefore the

<p>Here, the factor <span class="math">\(a_p=a_{pnd}a_{lvl}\)</span> averages the reduced snow
depth over the ponds with the full snow depth over the remainder of the
ice; that is, <span class="math">\(h_s^{eff} = h_s(1-a_p) + (h_s -h_p^{eff})a_p.\)</span></p>
<p>Case 2: Similarly, for <span class="math">\(V_p \ge V_{mx}\)</span>, the total mass in the

<p><em>Drainage.</em> A portion <span class="math">\(1-r\)</span> of the available melt water drains
immediately into the ocean. Once the volume changes described above have
been applied and the resulting pond area and depth calculated, the pond
depth may be further reduced if the top surface of the ice would be
below sea level or if the sea ice becomes permeable.</p>
<p>We require that the sea ice surface remain at or above sea level. If the
weight of the pond water would push the mean ice–snow interface of a

<p>There is a separate freeboard calculation in the thermodynamics which

<p><em>Conservation elsewhere.</em> When ice ridges and when new ice forms in open

appropriately. For example, when sea ice deforms, some of the level ice
is transformed into ridged ice. We assume that pond water (and ice) on

<p>Two methods for computing albedo and shortwave fluxes are available, the
“ccsm3” method, described below, and a multiple scattering
radiative transfer scheme that uses a Delta-Eddington approach.
“Inherent” optical properties (IOPs) for snow and sea ice, such as
extinction coefficient and single scattering albedo, are prescribed
based on physical measurements; reflected, absorbed and transmitted
shortwave radiation (“apparent” optical properties) are then computed
for each snow and ice layer in a self-consistent manner. Absorptive
effects of inclusions in the ice/snow matrix such as dust and algae can
also be included, along with radiative treatment of melt ponds and other
changes in physical properties, for example granularization associated
with snow aging. The Delta-Eddington formulation is described in detail
in <a class="reference internal" href="../zreferences.html#bl07" id="id16">[7]</a>. Since publication of this technical paper,
a number of improvements have been made to the Delta-Eddington scheme,

<p>The namelist parameters <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">R_ice</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">R_pnd</span></code> adjust the albedo of bare or
ponded ice by the product of the namelist value and one standard
deviation. For example, if <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">R_ice</span></code> = 0.1, the albedo increases by
<span class="math">\(0.1\sigma\)</span>. Similarly, setting <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">R_snw</span></code> = 0.1 decreases the snow
grain radius by <span class="math">\(0.1\sigma\)</span> (thus increasing the albedo). Two
additional tuning parameters are available for this scheme, <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dT_mlt</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rsnw_mlt</span></code>. <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dT_mlt</span></code> is the temperature change needed for a change in snow
grain radius from non-melting to melting, and <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rsnw_mlt</span></code> is the maximum
snow grain radius when melting. An absorption coefficient for algae

<h3>2.6.2.2. Shortwave radiation: CCSM3<a class="headerlink" href="#shortwave-radiation-ccsm3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the parameterization used in the previous version of the Community
Climate System Model (CCSM3), the albedo depends on the temperature and
thickness of ice and snow and on the spectral distribution of the
incoming solar radiation. Albedo parameters have been chosen to fit
observations from the SHEBA field experiment. For
<span class="math">\(T_{sf} &lt; -1^{\circ}C\)</span> and <span class="math">\(h_i &gt; `\ ``ahmax`\)</span>, the bare ice
albedo is 0.78 for visible wavelengths (<span class="math">\(&lt;700\)</span>nm) and 0.36 for
near IR wavelengths (<span class="math">\(&gt;700\)</span>nm). As <span class="math">\(h_i\)</span> decreases from
ahmax to zero, the ice albedo decreases smoothly (using an arctangent
function) to the ocean albedo, 0.06. The ice albedo in both spectral
bands decreases by 0.075 as <span class="math">\(T_{sf}\)</span> rises from
<span class="math">\(-1^{\circ}C\)</span> to . The albedo of cold snow (<span class="math">\(T_{sf} &lt;
-1^{\circ}C\)</span>) is 0.98 for visible wavelengths and 0.70 for near IR
wavelengths. The visible snow albedo decreases by 0.10 and the near IR
albedo by 0.15 as <span class="math">\(T_{sf}\)</span> increases from <span class="math">\(-1^{\circ}C\)</span>
to <span class="math">\(0^{\circ}C\)</span>. The total albedo is an area-weighted average of the ice and snow

solar radiation is equal to zero for snow-covered ice, since most of the

<p>It is possible that more shortwave penetrates into an ice layer than is
needed to completely melt the layer, or else it causes the computed
temperature to be greater than the melting temperature, which until now
has caused the vertical thermodynamics code to abort. A parameter
<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">frac</span></code> = 0.9 sets the fraction of the ice layer than can be melted through.
A minimum temperature difference for absorption of radiation is also
set, currently <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dTemp</span></code> = 0.02 (K). The limiting occurs in
<strong>icepack_therm_vertical.F90</strong>, for both the ccsm3 and delta Eddington
radiation schemes. If the available energy would melt through a layer,
then penetrating shortwave is first reduced, possibly to zero, and if
that is insufficient then the local conductivity is also reduced to
bring the layer temperature just to the melting point.</p>
<p>We now convert Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-ice-temp-change">(43)</a> to finite-difference form. The
resulting equations are second-order accurate in space, except possibly
at material boundaries, and first-order accurate in time. Before writing
the equations in full we give finite-difference expressions for some of
the terms.</p>
<p>First consider the terms on the left-hand side of
Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-ice-temp-change">(43)</a>. We write the time derivatives as</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} =

<p>which ensures that energy is conserved during a change in temperature.
This can be shown by using Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-heat-capacity">(44)</a> to integrate
<span class="math">\(c_i \, dT\)</span> from <span class="math">\(T_{ik}^m\)</span> to <span class="math">\(T_{ik}^{m+1}\)</span>; the

is given by Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-heat-capacity-fd">(47)</a>. The specific heat is a nonlinear
function of <span class="math">\(T_{ik}^{m+1}\)</span>, the unknown new temperature. We can
retain a set of linear equations, however, by initially guessing
<span class="math">\(T_{ik}^{m+1} = T_{ik}^m\)</span> and then iterating the solution,
updating <span class="math">\(T_{ik}^{m+1}\)</span> in Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-heat-capacity-fd">(47)</a> with each

and <span class="math">\(\Delta h\)</span> are the thermal conductivity and thickness of the

<p>where <span class="math">\(\eta_k = \Delta t/(\rho_k c_k \Delta h_k)\)</span>. In the
equation for the bottom ice layer, the temperature at the ice–ocean
interface is held fixed at <span class="math">\(T_f\)</span>, the freezing temperature of the
mixed layer; thus the last term on the LHS is known and is moved to the
RHS. If <span class="math">\(T_{sf} = 0^{\circ}C\)</span> , then there is no surface flux
equation. In this case the first equation in Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-tridiag">(42)</a> is similar
to Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-tridiag-form">(52)</a>, but with the first term on the LHS moved to the
RHS.</p>
<p>These equations are modified if <span class="math">\(T_{sf}\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(F_{ct}\)</span> are computed within the atmospheric model and
passed to the host sea ice model (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">calc_Tsfc</span></code> = false; see <a class="reference internal" href="sg_boundary_forcing.html#atmo"><span class="std std-ref">Atmosphere</span></a>). In this case there
is no surface flux equation. The top layer temperature is computed by an
equation similar to Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-tridiag-form">(52)</a> but with the first term on the
LHS replaced by <span class="math">\(\eta_1 F_{ct}\)</span> and moved to the RHS. The
main drawback of treating the surface temperature and fluxes explicitly
is that the solution scheme is no longer unconditionally stable.
Instead, the effective conductivity in the top layer must satisfy a
diffusive CFL condition:</p>
<div class="math">
\[K^* \le {\rho ch \over \Delta t}.\]</div>
<p>For thin layers and typical coupling intervals (<span class="math">\(\sim 1\)</span> hr),
<span class="math">\(K^*\)</span> may need to be limited before being passed to the atmosphere
via the coupler. Otherwise, the fluxes that are returned to the host sea ice model may
result in oscillating, highly inaccurate temperatures. The effect of
limiting is to treat the ice as a poor heat conductor. As a result,
winter growth rates are reduced, and the ice is likely to be too thin
(other things being equal). The values of <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hs_min</span></code> and <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>
must therefore be chosen with care. If <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hs_min</span></code> is too small, frequent
limiting is required, but if <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hs_min</span></code> is too large, snow will be ignored
when its thermodynamic effects are significant. Likewise, infrequent
coupling requires more limiting, whereas frequent coupling is
computationally expensive.</p>
<p>This completes the specification of the matrix equations for the four
cases. We compute the new temperatures using a tridiagonal solver. After
each iteration we check to see whether the following conditions hold:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><span class="math">\(T_{sf} \leq 0^{\circ}C\)</span>.</li>
<li>The change in <span class="math">\(T_{sf}\)</span> since the previous iteration is
less than a prescribed limit, <span class="math">\(\Delta T_{\max}\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math">\(F_0 \geq F_{ct}\)</span>. (If <span class="math">\(F_0 &lt; F_{ct}\)</span>, ice would be
growing at the top surface, which is not allowed.)</li>
<li>The rate at which energy is added to the ice by the external fluxes
equals the rate at which the internal ice energy is changing, to
within a prescribed limit <span class="math">\(\Delta F_{\max}\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We also check the convergence rate of <span class="math">\(T_{sf}\)</span>. If <span class="math">\(T_{sf}\)</span>
is oscillating and failing to converge, we average temperatures from
successive iterations to improve convergence. When all these conditions
are satisfied—usually within two to four iterations for
<span class="math">\(\Delta T_{\max} \approx 0.01^{\circ}C\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\Delta F_{max}
\approx 0.01 \ \mathrm{W/m^2}\)</span>—the calculation is complete.</p>
<p>To compute growth and melt rates (<a class="reference internal" href="#thermo-growth"><span class="std std-ref">Growth and melting</span></a>),
we derive expressions for the enthalpy <span class="math">\(q\)</span>. The enthalpy of snow
(or fresh ice) is given by</p>
<div class="math">
\[q_s(T) = - \rho_s (-c_0 T + L_0).\]</div>
<p>Sea ice enthalpy is more complex, because of brine pockets whose
salinity varies inversely with temperature. Since the salinity is
prescribed, there is a one-to-one relationship between temperature and
enthalpy. The specific heat of sea ice, given by
Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-heat-capacity">(44)</a>, includes not only the energy needed to warm or
cool ice, but also the energy used to freeze or melt ice adjacent to
brine pockets. Equation&nbsp;<a class="reference internal" href="#equation-heat-capacity">(44)</a> can be integrated to
give the energy <span class="math">\(\delta_e\)</span> required to raise the temperature of
a unit mass of sea ice of salinity <span class="math">\(S\)</span> from <span class="math">\(T\)</span> to
<span class="math">\(T^\prime\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\delta_e(T,T^\prime) = c_0 (T^\prime - T)
          + L_0 \mu S \left(\frac{1}{T} - \frac{1}{T^\prime}\right).\]</div>
<p>If we let <span class="math">\(T^\prime = T_{m} \equiv -\mu S\)</span>, the temperature at
which the ice is completely melted, we have</p>
<div class="math">
\[\delta_e(T,T_m) = c_0 (T_{m} - T)
                + L_0 \left(1 - \frac{T_m}{T}\right).\]</div>
<p>Multiplying by <span class="math">\(\rho_i\)</span> to change the units from
<span class="math">\(\mathrm {J/kg}\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\mathrm {J/m^{3}}\)</span> and adding a term
for the energy needed to raise the meltwater temperature to , we
obtain the sea ice enthalpy:</p>

<p>Note that Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-ice-enthalpy">(53)</a> is a quadratic equation in <span class="math">\(T\)</span>.

<p><em>Two-stage outer iteration</em></p>
<p>As for the BL99 thermodynamics
<a class="reference internal" href="../zreferences.html#bl99" id="id39">[6]</a> there are two qualitatively different
situations that must be considered when solving for the vertical
thermodynamics: the surface can be melting and at the melting
temperature, or the surface can be colder than the melting temperature
and not melting. In the BL99 thermodynamics these two situations were
treated within the same iterative loop, but here they are dealt with
separately. If at the beginning of the time step the ice surface is cold
and not melting, we solve the ice temperatures assuming that this is
also true at the end of the time step. Once we have solved for the new
temperatures we test to see if the answer is consistent with this
assumption. If the surface temperature is below the melting temperature
then we have found the appropriate consistent solution. If the surface
is above the melting temperature at the end of the initial solution
attempt, we recalculate the new temperatures assuming the surface
temperature is fixed at the melting temperature. Alternatively if the
surface is at the melting temperature at the start of a time step, we
assume initially that this is also the case at the end of the time step,
solve for the new temperatures and then check that the surface
conductive heat flux is less than the surface atmospheric heat flux as
is required for a melting surface. If this is not the case, the
temperatures are recalculated assuming the surface is colder than
melting. We have found that solutions of the temperature equations that
only treat one of the two qualitatively different solutions at a time
are more numerically robust than if both are solved together. The
surface state rarely changes qualitatively during the solution so the
method is also numerically efficient.</p>
<p><em>Temperature updates</em></p>
<p>During the calculation of the new temperatures
and salinities, the liquid fraction is held fixed at the value from the
previous time step. Updating the liquid fraction during the Picard
iteration described below was found to be numerically unstable. Keeping
the liquid fraction fixed drastically improves the numerical stability
of the method without significantly changing the solution.</p>
<p>Temperatures are calculated in a similar way to BL99 with an outer
Picard iteration of an inner tridiagonal matrix solve. The conservation
equation for the internal ice temperatures is</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{\partial{q}}{\partial{t}}=\frac{\partial{}}{\partial{z}} \left( K \frac{\partial{T}}{\partial{z}} \right) + w \frac{\partial{q_{br}}}{\partial{z}} + F\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(q\)</span> is the sea ice enthalpy, <span class="math">\(K\)</span> is the bulk thermal
conductivity of the ice, <span class="math">\(w\)</span> is the vertical Darcy velocity of the
brine, <span class="math">\(q_{br}\)</span> is the brine enthalpy and <span class="math">\(F\)</span> is the
internally absorbed shortwave radiation. The first term on the right
represents heat conduction and the second term represents the vertical
advection of heat by gravity drainage and flushing.</p>
<p>The conductivity of the mush is given by</p>
<div class="math">
\[K = \phi K_{br} + (1-\phi) K_{i}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(K_i = 2.3 \mathrm{Wm}^{-1}\mathrm{K}^{-1}\)</span> is the
conductivity of pure ice and
<span class="math">\(K_{br}=0.5375 \mathrm{Wm}^{-1}\mathrm{K}^{-1}\)</span> is the
conductivity of the brine. The thermal conductivity of brine is a
function of temperature and salinity, but here we take it as a constant
value for the middle of the temperature range experienced by sea ice,
<span class="math">\(-10^\circ\)</span>C <a class="reference internal" href="../zreferences.html#sp86" id="id40">[41]</a>, assuming the brine
liquidus salinity at <span class="math">\(-10^\circ\)</span>C.</p>
<p>We discretize the terms that include temperature in the heat
conservation equation as</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-mushyheat">
<span class="eqno">(55)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-mushyheat" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[\frac{q^{t}_k - q^{t_0}_k}{\Delta t} = \frac{\frac{K^*_{k+1}}{\Delta z^\prime_{k+1}} (T^t_{k+1} - T^t_k) - \frac{K^*_k}{\Delta z^\prime_k} (T^t_k - T^t_{k-1})}{\Delta h}\]</div>
<p>where the superscript signifies whether the quantity is evaluated at
the start (<span class="math">\(t_0\)</span>) or the end (<span class="math">\(t\)</span>) of the time step and the
subscript indicates the vertical layer. Writing out the temperature
dependence of the enthalpy term we have</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{\left(\phi (c_w \rho_w - c_i \rho_i) + c_i \rho_i\right) T^t_k - (1-\phi) \rho_i L - q^{t_0}_k}{\Delta t} = \frac{ \frac{K^*_{k+1}}{\Delta z^\prime_{k+1}} (T^t_{k+1} - T^t_k) - \frac{K^*_k}{\Delta z^\prime_k} (T^t_k - T^t_{k-1})}{\Delta h}.\]</div>
<p>The mush thermal conductivities are fixed at the start of the timestep.
For the lowest ice layer <span class="math">\(T_{k+1}\)</span> is replaced with
<span class="math">\(T_{bot}\)</span>, the temperature of the ice base. <span class="math">\(\Delta h\)</span> is
the layer thickness and <span class="math">\(z^\prime_k\)</span> is the distance between the
<span class="math">\(k-1\)</span> and <span class="math">\(k\)</span> layer centers.</p>
<p>Similarly, for the snow layer temperatures we have the following
discretized equation:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{c_i \rho_s T^t_k - \rho_s L_0- q^{t_0}_k}{\Delta t} = \frac{ \frac{K^*_{k+1}}{\Delta z^\prime_{k+1}} (T^t_{k+1} - T^t_k) - \frac{K^*_k}{\Delta z^\prime_k} (T^t_k - T^t_{k-1})}{\Delta h}.\]</div>
<p>For the upper-most layer (either ice layer or snow layer if it present)
<span class="math">\(T_{k-1}\)</span> is replaced with <span class="math">\(T_{sf}\)</span>, the temperature of the
surface.</p>
<p>If the surface is colder than the melting temperature then we also have
to solve for the surface temperature, <span class="math">\(T_{sf}\)</span>. Here we follow the
methodology of BL99 described above.</p>
<p>These discretized temperature equations form a tridiagional matrix for
the new temperatures and are solved with a standard tridiagonal solver.
A Picard iteration is used to incorporate nonlinearity in the equations.
The surface heat flux is a function of surface temperature and with each
iteration, the surface heat flux is calculated with the new surface
temperature until convergence is achieved. Convergence normally occurs
after a few iterations once the temperature changes during an iteration
fall below <span class="math">\(5\times10^{-4}\;^\circ\mathrm{C}\)</span> and the energy
conservation error falls below 0.9 <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ferrmax</span></code>.</p>
<p><em>Salinity updates</em></p>
<p>Several physical processes alter the sea ice bulk
salinity. New ice forms with the salinity of the sea water from which it
formed. Gravity drainage reduces the bulk salinity of newly formed sea
ice, while flushing of melt water through the ice also alters the
salinity profile.</p>
<p>The salinity equation takes the form</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{\partial{S}}{\partial{t}} = w \frac{\partial{S_{br}}}{\partial{z}} + G\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(w\)</span> is a vertical Darcy velocity and <span class="math">\(G\)</span> is a source
term. The right-hand side depends indirectly on the bulk salinity
through the liquid fraction (<span class="math">\(S = \phi S_{br}\)</span>). Since
<span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> is fixed for the time step, we solve the salinity equation
explicitly after the temperature equation is solved.</p>
<p>A. Gravity drainage. Sea ice initially retains all the salt present in
the sea water from which it formed. Cold temperatures near the top
surface of forming sea ice result in higher brine salinities there,
because the brine is always at its melting temperature. This colder,
saltier brine is denser than the underlying sea water and the brine
undergoes convective overturning with the ocean. As the dense, cold
brine drains out of the ice, it is replaced by fresher seawater,
lowering the bulk salinity of the ice. Following
<a class="reference internal" href="../zreferences.html#thb13" id="id41">[47]</a>, gravity drainage is assumed to occur as two

the ice base and a slow mode occurring everywhere.</p>
<p><em>Rapid drainage</em> takes the form of a vertically varying upward Darcy

<p>There are three tunable parameters in the above parameterization,

<p>The <em>slow drainage</em> mode takes the form of a simple relaxation of bulk

<p>B. Downwards flushing. Melt pond water drains through sea ice and
flushes out brine, reducing the bulk salinity of the sea ice. This is
modeled with the mushy physics option as a vertical Darcy flow through
the ice that affects both the enthalpy and bulk salinity of the sea ice:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\left.\frac{\partial{q}}{\partial{t}}\right|_{flush} = w_f \frac{\partial{q_{br}}}{\partial{z}}\]</div>
<div class="math">
\[\left.\frac{\partial{S}}{\partial{t}} \right|_{flush}= w_f \frac{\partial{S_{br}}}{\partial{z}}\]</div>
<p>These equations are discretized with an upwind advection scheme. The
flushing Darcy flow, <span class="math">\(w_f\)</span>, is given by</p>
<div class="math">
\[w_f=\frac{\overline{\Pi} \rho_w g \Delta h}{h \eta},\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\overline{\Pi}\)</span> is the harmonic mean of the ice layer
permeabilities and <span class="math">\(\Delta h\)</span> is the hydraulic head driving melt
water through the sea ice. It is the difference in height between the
top of the melt pond and sea level.</p>
<p><em>Basal boundary condition</em></p>
<p>In traditional Stefan problems the ice
growth rate is calculated by determining the difference in heat flux on
either side of the ice/ocean interface and equating this energy
difference to the latent heat of new ice formed. Thus,</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-growth-stefan">
<span class="eqno">(57)<a class="headerlink" href="#equation-growth-stefan" title="Permalink to this equation">¶</a></span>\[(1-\phi_i) L_0 \rho_i \frac{\partial{h}}{\partial{t}} = K \left. \frac{\partial{T}}{\partial{z}} \right|_i - K_w \left. \frac{\partial{T}}{\partial{z}} \right|_w\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\((1-\phi_i)\)</span> is the solid fraction of new ice formed and
the right hand is the difference in heat flux at the ice–ocean interface
between the ice side and the ocean side of the interface. However, with
mushy layers there is usually no discontinuity in solid fraction across
the interface, so <span class="math">\(\phi_i=1\)</span> and Equation <a class="reference internal" href="#equation-growth-stefan">(57)</a>
cannot be used explicitly. To circumvent this problem we set the
interface solid fraction to be 0.15, a value that reproduces
observations. <span class="math">\(\phi_i\)</span> is a namelist parameter (<code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">phi_i_mushy</span></code> =
0.85). The basal ice temperature is set to the liquidus temperature
<span class="math">\(T_f\)</span> of the ocean surface salinity.</p>
<p><em>Tracer consistency</em></p>
<p>In order to ensure conservation of energy and salt
content, the advection routines will occasionally limit changes to
either enthalpy or bulk salinity. The mushy thermodynamics routine
determines temperature from both enthalpy and bulk salinity. Since the
limiting changes performed in the advection routine are not applied
consistently (from a mushy physics point of view) to both enthalpy and
bulk salinity, the resulting temperature may be changed to be greater
than the limit allowed in the thermodynamics routines. If this situation
is detected, the code corrects the enthalpy so the temperature is below
the limiting value. Conservation of energy is ensured by placing the
excess energy in the ocean, and the code writes a warning (see <a class="reference internal" href="../developer_guide/dg_col_phys.html#warning"><span class="std std-ref">The Warning Package</span></a>)
that this has
occurred to the diagnostics file. This situation only occurs with the
mushy thermodynamics, and it should only occur very infrequently and
have a minimal effect on results. The addition of the heat to the ocean
may reduce ice formation by a small amount afterwards.</p>

<p>In general, frazil ice formed in the ocean is added to the thinnest ice

<p>If the latent heat flux is negative (i.e., latent heat is transferred
from the ice to the atmosphere), snow or snow-free ice sublimates at the

For positive latent heat fluxes, the deposited snow or ice is assumed to

<p>At the end of the time step we check whether the

level when</p>
<div class="math">

<p>In this case, for <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ktherm</span></code> = 1 (BL99) we raise the snow base to sea level

<p>In rare cases this process can increase the ice thickness

<p>For <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ktherm</span></code> = 2 (mushy), we model the snow–ice formation process as
follows: If the ice surface is below sea level then we replace some snow
with the same thickness of sea ice. The thickness change chosen is that
which brings the ice surface to sea level. The new ice has a porosity of
the snow, which is calculated as</p>
<div class="math">
\[\phi = 1 - \frac{\rho_s}{\rho_i}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\rho_s\)</span> is the density of snow and <span class="math">\(\rho_i\)</span> is the
density of fresh ice. The salinity of the brine occupying the above
porosity within the new ice is taken as the sea surface salinity. Once
the new ice is formed, the vertical ice and snow layers are regridded
into equal thicknesses while conserving energy and salt.</p>
