Introduction - Icepack
**********************

The column physics of the sea ice model CICE, "Icepack", is maintained by the
CICE Consortium. This code includes several options for simulating sea ice
thermodynamics, mechanical redistribution (ridging) and associated area and thickness
changes.  In addition, the model supports a number of tracers, including
thickness, enthalpy, ice age, first-year ice area, deformed ice area and volume,
melt ponds, and biogeochemistry.

Icepack is implemented in CICE as a git submodule.
Icepack basically consists of three independent parts, the column physics code,
the icepack driver that supports stand-alone testing of the column physics code, and the
icepack scripts that build and test the Icepack model.  
The intent of Icepack is to provide the column physics model as a separate
library for use in other models such as CICE.
Development and testing of CICE and Icepack may be done together,
but the repositories are independent.

This document uses the following text conventions:
Variable names used in the code are ``typewritten``.
Subroutine names are given in *italic*.
File and directory names are in **boldface**.
Code and scripts are contained in a literal box or ``typewritten``.
A comprehensive :ref:`index`, including glossary of symbols with many of their values, appears
at the end of this guide.

.. _quickstart:

Quick Start
===========

Download the model from the CICE-Consortium repository, 
    https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/Icepack

Instructions for working in github with Icepack (and CICE) can be
found in the `CICE Git and Workflow Guide <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rR6WAvZQT9iAMUp-m_HZ06AUCCI19mguFialsMCYs9o>`_.

From your main Icepack directory, execute::

  ./icepack.create.case -c ~/mycase1 -m testmachine
  cd ~/mycase1
  ./icepack.build
  ./icepack.submit

Note that testmachine is a generic machine name included with the icepack scripts.
The local machine name will have to be substituted for testmachine and currently,
there are working ports for several different machines.  However, it may be necessary
to port the model to a new machine.  See :ref:`porting` for 
more information about how to port and :ref:`scripts` for more information about 
how to use the icepack.create.case script.


Major Icepack updates since CICE v5.1.2
============================================

This model release is Icepack version 1.0.

The column physics code was separated from CICE version 5.1.2 by removing all references to
the horizontal grid and other infrastructural CICE elements (e.g. MPI tasks, calendar).  

- A simplified driver was developed for Icepack, for testing purposes. 
- Additional tests for the column physics are now available.
- This release includes the full vertical biogeochemistry code.
