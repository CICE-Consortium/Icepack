Citing the Icepack code
=======================

Each individual release has its own Digital Object Identifier (DOI),
e.g. Icepack v1.2.2 has DOI 10.5281/zenodo.3888633. All versions of
this lineage (e.g. Icepack v1) can be cited by using the DOI
10.5281/zenodo.1213462 (https://zenodo.org/record/1213462). This DOI
represents all v1 releases, and will always resolve to the latest one.
More information can be found by following the DOI link to zenodo.

If you use Icepack, please cite the version number of the code you
are using or modifying.

If using code from the CICE-Consortium repository ``master`` branch
that includes modifications
that have not yet been released with a version number, then in
addition to the most recent version number, the hash at time of
download can be cited, determined by executing the command ``git log``
in your clone.

A hash can also be cited for your own modifications, once they have
been committed to a repository branch.

Please also make the CICE Consortium aware of any publications and
model use.
