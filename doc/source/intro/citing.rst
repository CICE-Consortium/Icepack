Citing the Icepack code
=======================

If you use the Icepack code, please cite the version you are using 
with the Icepack Digital Object Identifier (DOI):

DOI:10.5281/zenodo.1213462 (https://zenodo.org/record/1213462) 

This DOI can be used to cite all Icepack versions and the URL will default to the most recent version. 
However, each released version of Icepack will also receive its own, unique DOI that can be 
used for citations as well.

Please also make the CICE Consortium aware of any publications and model use.
