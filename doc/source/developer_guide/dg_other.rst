Running with a Debugger
-------------------------

Availability and usage of interactive debuggers varies across machines.  Contact your 
system administrator for additional information about whatâ€™s available on your system.  
To run with an interactive debugger, the following general steps should be taken.

- Setup a case
- Modify the env file and Macros file to add appropriate modules and compiler/ linker flags
- Build the model
- Get interactive hardware resources as needed
- Open a csh shell
- Source the env.${machine} file
- Source cice.settings
- Change directories to the run directory
- Manually launch the executable thru the debugger
