Coding Standard
------------------------------------

The column physics is a library that solves the sea ice column physics on a 
timestep by timestep and gridpoint by gridpoint basis.  It consists of Fortran routines with 
input and output arguments.  The model state is saved in the host model.  There is no 
communication between gridcells so the underlying implementation
supports no parallelization.  It however can be called in parallel by a driver
that is running on multiple pes with a decomposed grid.

The column physics does not have a time manager.  Calendaring is expected to be
dealt with by the host model.  The column physics does not read any forcing data,
that is passed into the column physics though interfaces.  In fact, 
there are no direct IO capabilities in the column physics.  That is to say, the
column physics does not open files to read or write.  However, the column physics 
contains a warning and abort package (see section :ref:`aborts`) that
provides the column package with the ability to store log output.  That output can
be queried by the host model or it can be written directly via a specific routine.
The warning package also provides access to an abort flag that the host model can
query after each call to check for successful completion of the column physics package.

All column physics public interfaces and public data are defined in the **icepack_intfc.F90**
file (see section :ref:`calling`).  Internal column physics settings should all be accessible through interfaces.
The internal constants, parameters, and tracer settings have init (set), query (get), and
write interfaces that provides access to internal column physics settings.  The host model
should not have to use "use" statements to access any of the column physics data outside
of what is provided through the icepack_intfc module.  

The public column physics interfaces use optional arguments where it makes sense and
there is an ongoing effort to extend the optional arguments supported.  It's strongly recommended
that calls to the icepack interfaces be done with keyword=value arguments.  All icepack arguments
support this method.

Overall, columnphysics changes in the Icepack model should include the following

  * All modules should have the following set at the top

    .. code-block:: fortran

       implicit none
       private

  * Any public module interfaces or data should be explicitly specified

  * All subroutines and functions should define the subname character parameter statement to match the interface name like

    .. code-block:: fortran

       character(len=*),parameter :: subname='(lateral_melt_bgc)'

  * All interfaces that are public outside the Icepack columnphysics should include autodocument_start and autodocument_end comment lines with appropriate syntax and location.  If any interfaces are added or updated, then the internal documentation should be updated via

    .. code-block:: bash

       ./icepack.setup --docintfc

    See also :ref:`docintfc` for more information about the docintfc option.

  * The icepack_warnings package should be used to cache log messages and set the abort flag.  To add a log message, use icepack_warnings_add like

    .. code-block:: fortran

       call icepack_warnings_add(subname//' algorithm did not converge')

    To formally set the abort flag, use

    .. code-block:: fortran

       call icepack_warnings_setabort(.true.,__FILE__,__LINE__)

    See also :ref:`aborts` for more information about how the external calling program will write those message and check whether Icepack aborted.

  * Every interface call within the columnphysics should be followed by

    .. code-block:: fortran

       if (icepack_warnings_aborted(subname)) return

    to support errors backing up the call tree to the external program

  * Variables defined in icepack_kinds, icepack_tracers, icepack_parameters, and icepack_orbital should be accessed from WITHIN Icepack by Fortran use statements (even though this is not recommended for drivers).  It's also possible to use the public methods to access internal Icepack variables.  Again, from the icepack driver or other external programs, the columnphysics variables should ALWAYS be access thru the interface methods and icepack_intfc (see also :ref:`calling`).

  * Icepack is a simple serial code.  Global flags and parameters should be set identically on all tasks/threads that call into Icepack.  Icepack has no ability to reconcile or identify inconsistencies between different tasks/threads.  All aspects of correct parallel implementation is managed by the driver code.

  * Optional arguments are encouraged in the public Icepack interfaces.  They provide backwards compatibility in the public interfaces and allow future extensions.  Arguments that are not always required should ultimately be made optional.  There are several ways optional arguments can be passed down the calling tree in Icepack.  Two options, copying into local data or copying into module data are viable.  But the recommended approach is to pass optional arguments down the calling tree,

    * Optional arguments can be used as calls are made down the calling tree without regard to whether they are present or not.

    * Use universal flags and parameters to turn on/off features.  Avoid having features triggered by the presence of optional arguments.

    * Verify that the optional arguments required for any feature are passed in at the top level of each Icepack interface.  If not, then abort.

    * Leverage the icepack subroutine ``icepack_checkoptargflags`` which controls how often to check the optional arguments.  The ``argcheck`` namelist setting controls when to do the checks, 'never', 'first', or 'always' are valid settings 

    * Pass optional arguments down the calling tree within Icepack as needed.  In Fortran, the present attribute is carried down the calling tree automatically, but the ``optional`` attribute should also be defined in lower level subroutines.  This is not strictly required in cases where the subroutine is always called with the optional arguments, but it's good practice.

    * An example of how this might look is

      .. code-block:: fortran

         use icepack_parameters, only: flag_arg2, flag_arg3

         subroutine icepack_public_interface(arg1, arg2, arg3, ...)
         real (kind=dbl_kind), intent(inout) :: arg1
         real (kind=dbl_kind), optional, dimension(:), intent(inout) :: arg2
         real (kind=dbl_kind), optional, intent(inout) :: arg3

         logical, save :: first_call = .true.
         character(len=*), parameter :: subname = '(icepack_public_interface)'

         if (icepack_chkoptargflag(first_call)) then
            if (flag_arg2) then
               if (.not.present(arg2)) then
                  call icepack_warnings_setabort(.true.,__FILE__,__LINE__)
                  call icepack_warnings_add(subname//' flag_arg2 set but arg2 not passed')
               endif
            endif
            if (flag_arg3) then
               if (.not.present(arg3)) then
                  call icepack_warnings_setabort(.true.,__FILE__,__LINE__)
                  call icepack_warnings_add(subname//' flag_arg3 set but arg3 not passed')
               endif
            endif
            if (icepack_warnings_aborted(subname)) return
         endif

         ...
         call some_columnphysics_subroutine(arg1, arg2, arg3, ...)
         ...

         first_call = .false.

         end subroutine

         !------------

         subroutine some_columnphysics_subroutine(arg1, arg2, arg3, ...)

         real (kind=dbl_kind), intent(inout) :: arg1
         real (kind=dbl_kind), optional, dimension(:), intent(inout) :: arg2
         real (kind=dbl_kind), optional, intent(inout) :: arg3

         if (flag_arg2) then
            arg2(:) = ...
         endif

         if (flag_arg3) then
            call someother_columnphysics_subroutine(arg3)
         endif

         end subroutine

         !------------

         subroutine someother_columnphysics_subroutine(arg3)

         real (kind=dbl_kind), optional, intent(inout) :: arg3

         arg3 = ...

         end subroutine


    Some notes

    * If optional arguments are passed but not needed, this is NOT an error.  If optional argument are not passed but needed, this is an error.

    * If checking and implementation are done properly, optional arguments that are not needed will never be referenced anywhere in Icepack at that timestep.  Optional arguments should be matched with the appropriate flags at the first entry into Icepack as much as possible.

    * There is a unit test (optarg) in CICE to verify optional argument passing.  There is also a unit test (opticep) in CICE that checks that NOT passing the optional arguments from CICE is robust.
