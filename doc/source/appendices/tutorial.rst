CICE Consortium Tutorial

Standalone Icepack pre-tutorial activity

Learning Goals

In this activity you will clone the Icepack model code from the Consortium GitHub repository to  run standalone Icepack simulations. You will also make namelist changes and code modifications for experiments and make some basic plots. We hope you can get Icepack installed and running before the CICE Consortium meeting. Hopefully you can get most of the way through this, at least to the Running Icepack longer step. If you run into issues, contact dbailey@ucar.edu

Notes:
A right-facing angle bracket (>) followed by text denotes a command you need to enter at the command line on the computer, but without the angle bracket.
When there is the <X> syntax, you need to fill in your personal information (e.g. a URL or username) for that command but without the angle brackets. Your GitHub and local computer usernames may not be the same, so check which you need to use.
There is a lot of documentation.
